# MovieNow App
We created an App called MovieNow App that allows the users to not only search for a movie title but theyâ€™re able to browse and Trending Movies, Top Rated Movies and Now Playing and Upcoming Movies that pulled from the movie database api. The purpose of our app truly allows the user to save the movie they wish to watch into their wishlist and then after they watch it, they may move it into their watchlist. Once the user selects an movie, they may view a summary of the movie and a trailer pulled from youtube along with a section showing the user recommended movies based on the movie selected.
